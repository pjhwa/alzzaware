# This makes a bootkernel disk in /dev/fd0 from a kernel image.
#
# Run this in a directory containing the kernels you're gonna use, and a
# subdirectory with a master image of the bootkernel disk.
#
# This is the command to use:
#
# makedisk kernel_image disk_size
#          ^^           ^^^^^^^^^ This is 1440 or 1200
#          ^^^^^ This is the name (and maybe path to) the kernel you're going
#                to use, such as scsinet/zImage.
