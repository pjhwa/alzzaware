This is the Hurd.  Welcome.

This is the complete GNU system, version 0.0.  

This directory contains i386 binaries for the Hurd and various
programs built to run under it.  

See the file SOURCES to see where each package came from.  Remember
that you must adhere to the GNU General Public License and the GNU
Library General Public when distributing this binary snapshot.  See
/share/misc/COPYING and /share/misc/COPYING.LIB for copies of these
licenses.

For instructions on installing binary images and setting up a Hurd
system, see the file INSTALL-binary.  

Bug reports for programs in this distribution should be sent to the
maintainer of the program.  For a complete list of which mailing lists
get bug reports for which programs, ask `gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu'.

Bug reports for the GNU Hurd should be sent to the mailing list
`bug-hurd@prep.ai.mit.edu'.  Please do not send requests for
assistance in installing or using the software to that address.
Instead, send requests for assistance to the mailing list
`help-hurd@prep.ai.mit.edu'.  You can join these lists by sending a
request to `bug-hurd-request@prep.ai.mit.edu' or
`help-hurd-request@prep.ai.mit.edu' respectively.

In addition, bug reports or requests for help in using the system as a
connected whole (as opposed to for particular programs) should be sent
to the hurd mailing lists.

If any of these mailing address should fail, send your message to
`tower@gnu.ai.mit.edu' and ask him to forward it properly.

The GNU system is free software.  See the files /share/misc/COPYING
and /share/misc/COPYING.LIB.
