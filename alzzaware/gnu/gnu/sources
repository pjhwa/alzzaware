The following were compiled from the sources found in
ftp://prep.gnu.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gnu-0.0/hurd-special-src:

bash (1.14.4 patchlevel 10, with some additional local bugfixes)
e2fsprogs (e2fsprogs-0.5c-hurd1.tar.gz) [1.04 doesn't have hurd patches]
serverboot (serverboot.tar.gz)
  [ Unpack into the mach4 source directory, and rename it to be `bootstrap';

    subdir of the build directory, and install as /boot/serverboot. ]
from
grub
  [ Requires changes for ELF: avoid generating 16-bit relocations.
