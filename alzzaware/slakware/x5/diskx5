oldlibs5: Shared X libraries from XFree86 2.1.1 (X11R5).
oldlibs5:
oldlibs5: This package adds libX11.so.3.1.0, libXaw.so.3.1.0, and
oldlibs5: libXt.so.3.1.0 to your /usr/i486-linuxaout/lib directory.  Although
oldlibs5: most X software in Slackware has been recompiled to use the new X
oldlibs5: libraries, there's still plenty of software out there that will
oldlibs5: require these libraries for compatibility with XFree86 3.1.2.
oldlibs5:
oldlibs5: X DOOM requires these libraries.

oldlibs5:
oldlibs6: a.out (DLL) format shared libraries for X11R6 binaries.
oldlibs6:
oldlibs6: These libraries go in /usr/i486-linuxaout/lib, where they will be used
oldlibs6: to provide backwards compatibility for dynamically linked a.out format
oldlibs6: X binaries.  Also includes shared stubs (.sa) for compiling a.out
oldlibs6: X applications with 'gcc -b i486-linuxaout'.
