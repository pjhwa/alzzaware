ghstview: Ghostview 1.5
ghstview:

gnuplot:  gnuplot 3.5
gnuplot:
gnuplot:  Gnuplot is a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility
gnuplot:  for UNIX, MSDOS, and VMS platforms.  The software is copyrighted but
gnuplot:  freely distributed (i.e., you don't have to pay for it).  It was
gnuplot:  originally intended as graphical program which would allow scientists
gnuplot:  and students to visualize mathematical functions and data.  Gnuplot
gnuplot:  supports many different types of terminals, plotters, and printers
gnuplot:  (including many color devices, and pseudo-devices like LaTeX) and is
gnuplot:  easily extensible to include new devices.

gs_x11:   Replacement /usr/bin/gs with X11 options compiled in.
gs_x11:
gs_x11:   This should be installed on top of the 'ghostscr' package from the
gs_x11:   A series to provide X11 support for ghostview. If you plan to preview
gs_x11:   Postscript documents under X, you need to install this. Also, if 
gs_x11:   you've installed ghostscript already it is highly recommended that you
gs_x11:   install this package just in case. Since it replaces another binary
gs_x11:   it really only uses about 25K.
