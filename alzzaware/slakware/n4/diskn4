netpipes: Robert Forsman's netpipes package makes TCP/IP streams usable in shell
netpipes: scripts.  It can also simplify client/server code by allowing the

netpipes: what you can do with 'faucet' and 'hose', two netpipes commands:
netpipes: 
netpipes: server$ faucet 3000 -out tar cf - .
netpipes: client$ hose server 3000 -in tar xvf -
