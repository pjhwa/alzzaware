This is an unofficial HOWTO that describes how to use 'setup' and 'pkgtool'
to upgrade your Linux system.

------------------------------

  24-Aug-95 NOTE: Trying to upgrade to ELF Slackware from a.out Slackware will
  undoubtably cause you all kinds of problems.  Don't do it.

------------------------------

  14-Sep-94 NOTE: In my opinion, upgrading through this method is probably
  more trouble than it's worth. For instance, several commonly reported bugs
  are caused by improper upgrading -- mixing disks from different versions of
  the distribution and/or failing to remove old packages first. I think we 
  need to face the fact that things haven't quite settled down yet, and that
  until then it's not always possible to foresee differences in filesystem
  structure, daemons, utilities, etc, that can lead to problems with the
  system.  

  The *correct* and best way to upgrade to a new distribution version is to 
  back up everything you want saved and then reinstall from scratch. This is
  especially true for the A and N series disks. If you do upgrade packages from
  one of those disk sets, you should seriously consider which packages from the
  other one might be related somehow and install those too. Again, it can be
  tricky to know just which packages *are* related given the overall complexity
  of the Linux system. That's why unless you really know what you're doing there
  is a substantial risk of screwing up a system while attempting to upgrade it.

  Just a fair warning. :^)

------------------

One of the most commonly asked questions about Slackware (especially after any
major release) is: How do I upgrade my system?

Until recently, it seemed there were two routes you could go. You could back up
everything you wanted to save, and then reinstall from scratch. As anyone who's
done this can attest, it's a tedious process and there's almost always a couple
important files that don't get backed up. The other option was to install the
new packages over the old system. This works, but any old files that aren't
overwritten by new ones will be left in your filesystem. This wastes space, and
makes system administration difficult, especially when configuration files
that are ignored by the new binaries are left behind.

The new versions of 'pkgtool' (a package maintenance tool developed for the
Slackware distribution) should provide a clean upgrade path from earlier
versions of Slackware. Since it can now remove packages from your hard drive 
while running on a self-contained Linux filesystem loaded into a ramdisk, it
can remove *any* files from your system, including ones that were difficult 
or impossible to remove while running on the harddrive. Files such as the
shell, shared libraries, init, and other crucial system files.

Here's how you'd upgrade to a newer version of Slackware from any previous
version that supports package information files in /var/adm/packages. (If
your system puts these files elsewhere, you might still be able to do this
by creating a symbolic link from the package information directory to 
/var/adm/packages)

1. Back up important files, or take your chances. ;^)

   Odds are you'll come through ok. However, there are two important
   exceptions to this rule. The first (and most obvious) is when a package
   overwrites a file you meant to keep with a new one. The second, and 
   possibly more serious situation is when the system needs to replace an
   existing file with a symbolic link. It *will* replace the file, whether
   it's a simple file, a file that's chmoded 444, or a directory filled with
   other subdirectories, each containing part of your Doctoral dissertation.
   So, be careful.

2. Make a list of the packages you plan to replace.

3. Use a bootkernel disk to boot one of the root/install disks. Log in as
   root.

4. Mount your root Linux partitions under /mnt while logged into the
   install disk. The method used here differs depending on what filesystem
   you're using for Linux. Here are some examples:

   How to mount an ext2fs partition:

   mount /dev/hda1 /mnt -t ext2
	 ^^^^^^^^^
	 Replace this with the name of your root partition.

   Similarly, if the partition was of type xiafs, you would use this command:

   mount /dev/hda1 /mnt -t xiafs

   If you're using UMSDOS (the system that allows you to install onto an 
   existing MS-DOS filesystem), this is the command you would use:

   mount /dev/hda1 /mnt -t umsdos

   If you've got other partitions that are part of your Linux filesystem,
   mount them after you've mounted that root partition. The method is the
   same - for example, here's how you'd mount an ext2fs /usr partition:

   mount /dev/hda2 /mnt/usr -t ext2

5. Once the partition has been mounted, we need to activate swap space if
   the system has less than 8 MB of memory. (If you have 8 or more MB, you
   may go on to step 6)

   You may use either a swap partition or a swapfile. To get a quick listing
   of your partition information, you can always type 'fdisk -l'. Doing this
   on my machine provides the following information:

   Disk /dev/hda: 15 heads, 17 sectors, 1001 cylinders
   Units = cylinders of 255 * 512 bytes

      Device Boot  Begin   Start     End  Blocks   Id  System
      /dev/hda1          10      10      90   10327+   1  DOS 12-bit FAT
      /dev/hda2          91      91    1000  116025    5  Extended
      /dev/hda3   *       1       1       9    1139    a  OPUS
      /dev/hda5   *      91      91    1000  116016+   6  DOS 16-bit >=32M

      Disk /dev/hdb: 16 heads, 31 sectors, 967 cylinders
      Units = cylinders of 496 * 512 bytes

      Device Boot  Begin   Start     End  Blocks   Id  System
      /dev/hdb1   *       1       1     921  228392+   6  DOS 16-bit >=32M
      /dev/hdb2         922     922     966   11160   82  Linux swap

  From this display, you can see that /dev/hdb2 has been designated as the
  Linux swap partition. If the partition has not been previously prepared
  with mkswap, here's how that would be done:

  mkswap /dev/hdb2 11160

  To activate the swap partition, you would type:

  swapon /dev/hdb2

  6. Remove the packages! To do this, type 'pkgtool' and select the option 
  remove installed packages. You'll be given a list of packages that you've
  installed - just select the list of packages that you plan to replace.

  If you're using one of the full-color versions of pkgtool, you select the
  packages to remove by removing up and down through the list with '+' and
  '-' and toggling packages to remove with the spacebar. Once you've toggled
  all the packages you want to remove, hit ENTER to remove them.

  If you're using one of the tty based versions of pkgtool, you'll have to 
  type in the names of the packages you with to remove. Separate each name
  with a space. Don't worry about how long the line ends up - just keep
  typing in the names until you've entered them all, and then hit ENTER to
  remove them.

That's it! Now you've cleaned up the old packages and you're ready to install 
the new ones. Type 'setup' and proceed to install the new packages as normal.

Although it never hurts to play it safe and remove all packages from the 
bootdisk, almost all of them can be removed using pkgtool from your hard
drive. The A series is the important exception here.

I wish everyone good luck with this! :^)
