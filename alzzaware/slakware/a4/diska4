ibcs2:    Intel Binary Compatibility Specification module
ibcs2:     
ibcs2:    The iBCS module allows many binaries from other OS's to run on Linux:
ibcs2:     
ibcs2:    i386 BSD (386BSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, BSDI/386) - very alpha.
ibcs2:    SVR4 (Interactive, Unixware, USL, Dell etc.)
ibcs2:    SVR3 generic
ibcs2:    SCO (SVR3 with extensions for symlinks and long filenames)
ibcs2:    Wyse V/386 (SVR3 with extensions for symlinks)
ibcs2:    Xenix V/386 (386 small model binaries only)
ibcs2:
ide:      Linux kernel version 2.0.0, without SCSI support.
ide:  
ide:      A Linux kernel for computers that do not need SCSI support. You MUST
ide:      install a kernel image in order for your system to boot. This kernel
ide:      supports IDE hard drives and IDE CD-ROM drives.  Other drivers (such
ide:      as for CD-ROM drives on proprietary interfaces, or ethernet cards)
ide:      may be loaded as modules.  See /etc/rc.d/rc.modules for examples.

keytbls:  kbd 0.90
keytbls:
keytbls:  Load and save keyboard mappings. Needed if you are not using the US
keytbls:  keyboard map. This package also contains utilities to change your
keytbls:  console fonts - if you install it you'll get a menu later on that lets
keytbls:  you select from many different fonts. If you like one, you can make it
keytbls:  your default font. A new default font can be chosen at any time by
keytbls:  typing 'fontconfig'. This package includes fonts from the 
keytbls:  kbd_fonts.tar.gz package uploaded to SunSITE.

ldso:     ld.so 1.7.14, the dynamic linker/loader.
ldso:
ldso:     ld.so completes the final process of linking all necessary references
ldso:     to sharable objects and unreferenced symbols in an impure executable,
ldso:     (usually a dynamically linked executable), to produce a runnable file.
ldso:     Nearly all Linux binaries are 'incomplete' and require further linking
ldso:     at run time. ld.so's job is thus to complete the linking process 
ldso:     started at compilation. ld.so was written by David Engel, 
ldso:     Eric Youngdale, Peter MacDonald, Hongjiu Lu, Linus Torvalds,
ldso:     Lars Wirzenius and Mitch D'Souza.

sysklogd: Sysklogd 1.2
sysklogd:
sysklogd: Dr. Greg Wettstein and Stephen Tweedie's syslogd/klogd.
sysklogd:
sysklogd: This package contains a modified version of syslogd for the Linux
sysklogd: environment.  An additional utility, klogd, is included which allows
sysklogd: kernel logging to be directed through the syslogd facility.
sysklogd: Syslogd and klogd are started when your system boots.
