jpeg:     Software to implement JPEG image compression and decompression. JPEG
jpeg:     (pronounced 'jay-peg') is a standardized compression method for 
jpeg:     full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing
jpeg:     'real-world' scenes; cartoons and other non-realistic images are not
jpeg:     its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, however, on typical images of 
jpeg:     real-world scenes, very good compression levels can be obtained with
jpeg:     no visible change, and amazingly high compression levels are possible
jpeg:     if you can tolerate a low-quality image.
