ash:      Kenneth Almquist's ash shell.
ash:
ash:      A lightweight (62K) Bourne compatible shell. Great for machines with
ash:      low memory, but does not provide all the extras of shells like bash,
ash:      tcsh, and zsh. Runs most shell scripts compatible with the Bourne
ash:      shell. Note that under Linux, most scripts seem to use at least some
ash:      bash-specific syntax. The Slackware setup scripts are a notable
ash:      exception, since ash is the shell used on the install disks. NetBSD
ash:      uses ash as its /bin/sh.

bc:       GNU bc 1.03 - An arbitrary precision calculator language.
bc:
bc:       bc is a language that supports arbitrary precision numbers with 
bc:       interactive execution of statements.  There are some similarities in
bc:       the syntax to the C programming language.

ghostscr: Ghostscript version 2.6.2
ghostscr: Preview, print and process PostScript documents on both PostScript and
ghostscr: non-PostScript devices. This version supports all SVGAlib video modes
ghostscr: for output directly to the screen. See the man page for 'gs' for more
ghostscr: information. [NOTE]: The /usr/bin/gs binary included with this package
ghostscr: does not support X11; support was left out so that Slackware users 
ghostscr: without X could use SVGAlib output and not need to install the X 
ghostscr: shared libraries. If you need X11 support, you should also install the
ghostscr: package 'gs_x11' found on the XAP series. It contains a /usr/bin/gs
ghostscr: with support for X11 (as well as full SVGAlib support).

gp9600:   Change the default modem speed from 9600 baud.
gp9600:
gp9600:   By default, your baud rate will be set to 9600. If you install this
gp9600:   package, a menu will be presented later which allows you to select any
gp9600:   of the following baud rates:
gp9600:
gp9600:   300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400.
gp9600:
gp9600:   If you need something faster than this, you should set the baud to
gp9600:   38400, which can be changed to mean a faster rate with setserial.

mt_st:    mt-st-0.4 - controls magnetic tape drive operation
mt_st:
mt_st:    This mt originates from BSD NET-2. Some Linux SCSI tape-specific
mt_st:    ioctls have been added to the original source and the man page has
mt_st:    been updated. Although this mt program is tailored for SCSI tape, it
mt_st:    can also be used with the QIC-02 driver and hopefully with other Linux
mt_st:    tape drivers using the same ioctls (some of the commands may not work
mt_st:    with all drivers).

quota:    Linux disk quota utilities (1.51)
quota:
quota:    An implementation of the diskquota system for the Linux operating
quota:    system -- keeps those greedy users from gobbling up 100% of the hard
quota:    drive space. Should work for all filesystems because of integration 
quota:    into the VFS layer of the operating system. This system is a heavily
quota:    modified version of the Melbourne quota system by Robert Elz, which
quota:    uses both user and group quota files. Edvard Tuinder <ed@ow.org> and
quota:    Marco van Wieringen <mvw@planets.ow.org> are responsible for the 
quota:    additional code and porting effort to make quotas work on Linux.

sudo:     sudo 1.2
sudo:
sudo:     'sudo' is a command that allows users to execute some commands as 
sudo:     root. The /etc/sudoers file (edited with 'visudo') specifies which
sudo:     users have access to sudo and which commands they can run. 'sudo' logs
sudo:     all its activities to /var/adm/sudo, so the system administrator can
sudo:     can keep an eye on things.
