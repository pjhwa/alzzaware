less:     Less is a paginator similar to more (1), but which allows backward
less:     movement in the file as well as forward movement. Also, less does not
less:     have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large
less:     input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi (1).

lilo:     LILO 19
lilo:
lilo:     Generic Boot Loader for Linux ('LInux LOader') by Werner Almesberger.
lilo:     LILO boots Linux from your hard drive. It can also boot other
lilo:     operating systems such as MS-DOS and OS/2, and can even boot DOS from
lilo:     the second hard drive. LILO comes with utilities and documentation
lilo:     that make it easier to install, such as 'liloconfig' and 'QuickStart'.
lilo:     NOTE: Installing boot loaders is inherently dangerous. Be sure to have
lilo:     some means to boot your system from a different media if you install
lilo:     LILO on your hard disk.

pcmcia:   pcmcia-cs-2.8.17
pcmcia:
pcmcia:   Card Services for Linux is a complete PCMCIA support package.  It
pcmcia:   includes a set of loadable kernel modules that implement a version of
pcmcia:   the PCMCIA Card Services applications program interface, a set of
pcmcia:   client drivers for specific cards, and a card manager daemon that can
pcmcia:   respond to card insertion and removal events, loading and unloading
pcmcia:   drivers on demand.  It supports ``hot swapping'' of PCMCIA cards, so
pcmcia:   cards can be inserted and ejected at any time.

sysvinit: SysVinit v. 2.62
sysvinit:
sysvinit: System V style init programs by Miquel van Smoorenburg that control
sysvinit: the booting and shutdown of your system. These support a number of
sysvinit: system runlevels, each with a specific set of utilities spawned. For
sysvinit: example, the normal system runlevel is 5, which starts agetty on 
sysvinit: virtual consoles tty1 - tty6. Runlevel 4 starts xdm. Runlevel 0 shuts
sysvinit: the system down. See the documentation in /usr/doc/sysvinit and the
sysvinit: scripts in /etc/rc.d for more information.
