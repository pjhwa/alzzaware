terminfo: Complete /usr/lib/terminfo database.
terminfo:
terminfo: This is the the master terminfo database maintained by Eric Raymond.
terminfo: This database is the official descendant of the 4.4BSD termcap file,
terminfo: and includes information about virtually every terminal known. The
terminfo: ncurses libraries use this database to adjust screen output for the
terminfo: terminal type in use.  Unless you're allowing logins from terminal
terminfo: types other than the Linux console, xterms, or vt100 terminals, you
terminfo: probably won't need this database - a minimal /usr/lib/terminfo with
terminfo: support for those types is included in the ncurses package.
