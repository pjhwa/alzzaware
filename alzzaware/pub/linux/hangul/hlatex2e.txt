Installation

------------



Convert hangul.kty (and test.ks) with htex into hangul.sty (test.tex) and

move hangul.sty and all .fd files into a directory which are found by TeX

(see below also).



emx.exe (if you are in a VCPI environment) or rsx.exe (in a DPMI environment)

should be in the path; alternatively you can set the EMX and RSX environment

variables equal the path AND the name of emx.exe/rsx.exe .

emx.dll (for OS/2) must be in the libpath.





Use

---



Use hangul.sty as a package, e.g.



    \documentclass{article}

    \usepackage{hangul}         .



A new environment \begin{hangul} ... \end{hangul} is defined, wherein

six fonts are available:



      explicit      font                implicit

      switch        name                switch

     ------------------------------------------------------

        \mj         MyoungJo            \rmfamily

        \mjb        MyoungJo Bold       \rmfamily\bfseries

        \gt         Gothic              \sffamily

        \gs         BootGulssi          \rmfamily\itshape

        \gr         Graphic             \ttfamily

        \dr         Dinaru              \sffamily\bfseries



Additionally the font switch \bmf is provided, which selects sans serif bold

(and dinaru).



This table says that Hangul fonts obey the New Font Selection Scheme too!

E.g, to get a bold sans serif Hangul font, it's enough to say



    \sffamily\bfseries      .



To override the scheme, you can explicitly select a Hangul font with \mj etc.





To activate hangul names for \tableofcontents etc., say



    \captionshangul



inside the hangul environment.

Attention: this feature is still experimental.





You can find a complete hangul font library and all metric files in the

lj_han.zip package (it should be at the same place where you has found this

package).





To convert a file with Hangul KS encoding to TeX ASCII encoding (defined

in hangul.sty), use htex:



    htex [-a] input_file [output_file]     .



The program maps the KS codes into TeX macros. To insure working in

verbatim environments, some characters become active:



    128 - 142 ASCII or

    14 - 30 ASCII (except 26 and 27 ASCII) if the -a switch is set.



I implemented this switch to avoid conflicts with languages using extended

ASCII characters of many code pages on the PC.

You must say



    \usepackage[altencoding]{hangul}



in your document to activate the alternative encoding.





Attention! If the input file has characters in the range 161 <= ch <= 200

which are NOT Hangul KS encoded (e.g. Chinese GB encoded), you should

move all KS text in a separate file, convert it and insert the text again

in the original file.



If you use emTeX, you must create the LaTeX2e .fmt-file with the -r and -i

switches on (alas, -r disables TeX Code Pages, but if you use Chinese or

Japanese too, you can't use Code Pages either).
