These kernels are for experimental use and are unsupported by
Red Hat Software.  Use at your own risk.

To use a 1.3.57 kernel for install, you need to make a boot disk
from the 1.2.13 boot disk directory.  Use rawrite or dd for this
as specified in the Red Hat manual or the RedHat-HOWTO.  Then you
can copy a kernel from the bare directory here to that disk using
mcopy under Linux or copy under dos.  You should replace the "linux"
file on your boot floppy with this kernel image.  

You can now boot that floppy.  Also, you need to make a ramdisk image
from the ramdisk.img file in this directory.  Again, use rawrite or
dd for this.  This is the ONLY ramdisk you need.  

When you boot your boot disk, you must enter some parameters.  Use:

boot:  linux load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=1


NOTE:  PCMCIA Installs will NOT work with 1.3.57 kernels, only 1.2.13.
You will have to provide the proper modules if you want to make them 
work.
